Hi! I am a PhD candidate at NTNU, specializing in robotics and machine learning. I love to work with motivated teams on engaging projects. I have valuable experience from Vortex NTNU, Shift Hyperloop and an academic exhange to ETH ZÃ¼rich, and I look forward to participate and contribute to exciting projects in the future!

I love robots and the use they can do for us humans. I love to learn about their ways, and I hope to contribute to their development! ðŸ¤–
