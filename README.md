Hi! I am a student at NTNU, currently exchanging at ETH ZÃ¼rich. I am specializing in robotics and machine learning. I love to work with motivated teams on engaging projects! I have experience from Vortex NTNU and Shift Hyperloop, adn I look forward to participate and contribute to exciting projects in the future.

I love robots and the use they can do for us humans. I love to learn about their ways, and I hope to contribute to their development! ðŸ¤–
